# mobilearmbot

NOTE: Due to my experience with ROS, I decided that this project was a out of my scope (Currently, I'm having trouble due to my inexperience with moveit). Due to this, I will temporarily put this project on hold. Going forward, I'll likely work on a fixed arm instead so that I get familiar with moveit, and then come back to this in the future.

This is a ROS package that I'm working on. My end goal is to create a four wheel mobile manipulator.

This robot will probably not be viable to create in real life. My intent is to familarize myself with ROS, rather than
create a real robot.

Currently, I just want to have the entire robot described, so most of my efforts will be directed towards that. I plan to start
working on other files once the robot is fully described. For sensors, I currently only plan on having a laser scan & a camera. 

I'm planning on using a simple manipulator. 

Current file structure:
- mobilearmbot_description contains the urdf and xacro files that describe the robot. It also contains a rviz file that will be updated later. This directory also temporarily contains launch files
- mobilearmbot_moveit was autogenerated by the moveit setup assistant
- mobilearmbot_demos (currently working on this) will contain a demo of the robot driving to a can and picking it up, and then possibly driving back to the origin. This will not rely on sensors much, aside from the laser scan.


Future plans:
- Add a kinect or other type of sensor to allow for perception purposes (will be following moveit tutorials for this)
- Setup the gazebo file (basically just have some worlds & launch files)
- Add a teleop in mobilearmbot_teleop. Control will be done via keyboard: drive will be W,A,S,D. Currently need to come up with a plan for controlling the manipulator
- Setup ROS' navigation stack & try to add SLAM to the robot (I also have to learn how SLAM works)

Potential unused packages:
- mobilearmbot_control
- mobilearmbot_msgs
